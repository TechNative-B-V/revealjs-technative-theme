# About this presentation { data-background-color="#112f41" }

This proposal is made for improving the quality of the entire Super Application.

*from mobile device to database and everyting in between*

## Problem { data-background-color="#112f41" .center}

- Super Application has many software and network components
- Ownership of components is divided among multiple parties.
- Multiple Places where things can go wrong
- Problems can be app-crashes, performance issues, data loss.
- Many Client Devices
- Hard two debug, find causes for problem
- It's hard to see who is responsible for problems

## Brief solution outline { data-background-color="#112f41"  .center}

Our proposal can be roughly outlined with the following components:

- Make sure all major application components send relevant logs and metrics
- Store all data in a central indexed store
- Make all data available for Engineers for correlation when solving problems
- Create alerts for all known anomalies in collected data
- Centralize orchastration of e2e monitoring
